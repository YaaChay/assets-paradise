Costa Brava, Lebanon
The free-spirited Badri family escapes the toxic pollution and social unrest of Beirut by seeking refuge in a utopic 
mountain home theyâ€™ve devoted years to building for themselves. Unexpectedly, the government begins construction on a garbage landfill right outside their fence, bringing the trash and corruption of a whole country to their doorstep. As the landfill rises, so do family tensions, and the Badris are left with a 
choice: stay off the grid and stay true to their ideals, or leave their idyllic home and face the reality they fled.
