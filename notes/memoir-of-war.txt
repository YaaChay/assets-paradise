Memoir of War
In a haunting adaptation of her semi-autobiographical novel, famed author Marguerite Duras (Mélanie Thierry) must
 navigate the Resistance and the Gestapo to uncover the whereabouts of her imprisoned husband, Robert Antelme.
 After he¹s deported to Dachau in the midst of Nazi-occupied France, she becomes friendly with French collaborator 
Rabier to gain information at considerable risk to her underground cell. But as the months wear on, she must begin 
the process of confronting the unimaginable.
