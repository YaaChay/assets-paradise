My Name Is Sara
My Name Is Sara tells the true life story of Sara Goralnik, a 13-year-old Polish Jew whose entire family was killed 
by Nazis in September 1942. After a grueling escape to the Ukrainian countryside, Sara steals her Christian best friend’s identity and finds refuge in a small village, where she is taken in by a farmer and his young wife. 
She soon discovers the dark secrets of her employers’ marriage, compounding her own greatest secret that she must 
strive to protect, her true identity.
