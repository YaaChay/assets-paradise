Paradise Highway
Academy Award® winners Juliette Binoche and Morgan Freeman lead this riveting thriller 
set in the trucking industry and its seamy underbelly of human trafficking. To save the 
life of her brother (Frank Grillo), Sally (Binoche), a truck driver, reluctantly agrees 
to smuggle illicit cargo: a girl named Leila (Hala Finley). As Sally and Leila begin a 
danger-fraught journey across state lines, a dogged FBI operative (Freeman) sets out on their trail, determined to do whatever
 it takes to terminate a human-trafficking operation — and bring Sally and Leila to safety.
