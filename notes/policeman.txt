My Policeman
A beautifully crafted story of forbidden love and changing social conventions, 
My Policeman follows three young people - policeman Tom (Harry Styles), teacher Marion 
(Emma Corrin) and museum curator Patrick (David Dawson) as they embark on an emotional 
journey in 1950s Britain. Flashing forward to the 1990s, Tom (Linus Roache), Marion 
(Gina McKee) and Patrick (Rupert Everett) are still reeling with longing and regret, but 
now they have one last chance to repair the damage of the past. Based on the book by 
Bethan Roberts, director Michael Grandage carves a visually transporting, heart-stopping por
trait of three people caught up in the shifting tides of history, liberty, and forgiveness.
