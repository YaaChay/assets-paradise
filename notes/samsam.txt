SamSam
SamSam seems like he has it all: great family, great friends, and even his own flying saucer. But he is still trying to find one thing that will make his life even better - actual superpowers. Thanks to Mega, a mysterious new student in school, SamSam is about to find them - while learning what it really takes to fight monsters 
and how many ways there is to be a hero.
