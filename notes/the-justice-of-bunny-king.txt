The Justice of Bunny King
Bunny King (Essie Davis), a headstrong mother of two with a sketchy past, earns her keep 
by washing windows at traffic lights. Using her razor-sharp wit to charm money from 
gridlocked motorists, she saves every cent to get back the custody of her kids. After
 promising her daughter a birthday party, Bunny must fight the social services and break 
the rules to keep her word, but in doing so risks losing her children altogether. 
Accompanied by her niece Tonya (Thomasin McKenzie), a fierce teenager running away from 
home, Bunny is in a race against the clock and headed towards an epic showdown with the 
authorities.
