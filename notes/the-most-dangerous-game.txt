The Most Dangerous Game
A father and son on a steamer ship bound for a great hunting expedition in the wilds of Alaska are shipwrecked on a
 mysterious island. Greeted warmly by the island’s only resident — the wealthy and mysterious Baron Von Wolf — the 
relieved men are wined and dined and talk of hunting ensues. When their host reveals the true nature of his trophy hunts, the stranded men are forced to run for 
their lives or fight to survive with no way to escape the remote island that serves as the ultimate hunting ground.
