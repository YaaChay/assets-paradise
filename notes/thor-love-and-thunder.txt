Thor: Love and Thunder
The film finds Thor (Chris Hemsworth) on a journey unlike anything he’s ever faced – a quest for inner peace. But his
 retirement is interrupted by a galactic killer known as Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale), who seeks the extinction 
of the gods. To combat the threat, Thor enlists the help of King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Korg (Taika Waititi) and 
ex-girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who – to Thor’s surprise – inexplicably wields his magical hammer, 
Mjolnir, as the Mighty Thor. Together, they embark upon a harrowing cosmic adventure to uncoverthe mystery of the 
God Butcher’s vengeance and stop him before it’s too late.
