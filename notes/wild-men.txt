Wild Men
Armed only with a bow and an ensemble of animal skins, Martin sets off into the forest in a misguided attempt to
overcome his midlife crisis. A chance meeting with a fugitive named Musa leads to a twisted trip through the fjords 
with police, drug runners, and Martin's family not far behind. As an unlikely friendship develops and wildly original set-pieces unfold, M
artin's quest for manhood leads to deep and hilariously uncomfortable realizations about the presumed masculine ideal.
